            <p>
                Linus Torvalds is the world's most famous computer programmer and also its most famous Finn. He is the
                founder and coordinator of Linux, the Unix-like operating system that is beginning to revolutionize the
                computer industry and possibly much else as well. His is truly one of the great tales in the history of
                the computers.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In 1987 Torvalds used his savings to buy his first computer, a Sinclair QL. This was one of the
                    world's first 32-bit computers for home use. With its Motorola 68008 processor. He soon became
                    unhappy with it because of it could not be reprogrammed due to the operating system residing in ROM.
                </li>
                <li>In early 1991 he purchased an IBM-compatible personal computer. As intrigued as he was with the
                    hardware, however, Torvalds was disappointed with the MS-DOS operating system that came with it. He
                    thus strongly preferred the much more powerful and stable UNIX operating system that he had become
                    accustomed to using on the university's computers.</li>
                <li>Consequently, Torvalds attempted to obtain a version of UNIX for his new computer. Fortunately (for
                    the world), he could not find even a basic system for less than US$5,000. He also considered MINIX,
                    a small clone of UNIX that was created by operating systems expert Andrew Tanenbaum in the
                    Netherlands to teach UNIX to university students. MINIX still had some serious disadvantages. They
                    included the facts that not all of the source code was made public, it lacked some of the features
                    and performance of UNIX and there was a not-insignificant.</li>
                <li>Torvalds thus decided to create a new operating system from scratch that was based on both MINIX and
                    UNIX. It is unlikely that he was fully aware of the tremendous amount of work that would be
                    necessary, and it is even far less likely that he could have envisioned the effects that his
                    decision would have both on his life and on the rest of the world. </li>
                <li>Because university education in Finland is free and there was little pressure to graduate within
                    four years, Torvalds decided to take a break and devote his full attention to his project.</li>
                <li>Torvalds is now working on the Linux kernel full-time for Open Source Development Lab (OSDL), which
                    is based in Beaverton, Oregon. Founded in 2000 and supported by a global consortium of computer
                    companies, including IBM, OSDL describes its mission as "becoming the recognized center of gravity
                    for Linux and the central body dedicated to accelerating the use of Linux for enterprise computing."
