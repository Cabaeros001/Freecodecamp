- About "box model"

    Now that you have reset the html box model, you need to pass that on to the elements within as well. To do this, you can set the box-sizing property to inherit, which will tell the targeted elements to use the same value as the parent element.

    You will also need to target the pseudo-elements, which are special keywords that follow a selector. The two pseudo-elements you will be using are the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements.

    The ::before selector creates a pseudo-element which is the first child of the selected element, while the ::after selector creates a pseudo-element which is the last child of the selected element. These pseudo-elements are often used to create cosmetic content, which you will see later in this project.

        html {
        box-sizing: border-box;
        }

        *, ::before, ::after {
        box-sizing: inherit; ---APLICA borderbox a todos los elemento---
        }


    float: left;

    content:"";
    The content property is used to set or override the content of the element. By default, the pseudo-elements created by the ::before and ::after pseudo-selectors are empty, and the elements will not be rendered to the page. content property to an empty string "" will ensure the element is rendered to the page while still being empty.

    When something is collapsing an go to other lines you might use the atribute: overflow set to hidden
         
         {
            overflow:hidden;
         }
